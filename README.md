# StationProject

RideShare Project

After 10 runs (all cars move once each run) and 50 people
    with 20 cars 24 people made it to their destination
    with 40 cars 28 people made it to their destination


This project takes the **People** object and transports them between **Stations** using **Cars**. The people have destinations they are trying to reach and the cars will transport them in the same direction the people are going. There are 32 stations and 50 people, the number of cars will change. Once the cars reach their destination, they will stop, unload all their passengers, and not take on any more passengers

For this project I am pround of finding ways around problems and constructing the methods to load the cars.
